# DSA Learning Journey - Recursion and Beyond!
=====================================================

## Repository Overview

This repository contains my progress and code implementations for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. After completing 30 lectures, This is a new repository to continue my learning journey, focusing on recursion and other advanced topics.

## Background

Due to some Git issues, I was unable to push my code to my previous repository. This new repository is a fresh start, where I'll be tracking my daily progress and committing my code regularly.

## What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find:

* **Code implementations** for various DSA problems and exercises
* **Focus on recursion** and its applications
* **Daily updates** and commits reflecting my progress
* A record of my learning journey, including **challenges, insights, and breakthroughs**

## Current Status

I've completed 30 lectures of the DSA course and have a solid foundation in the basics. Now, I'm diving into recursion and exploring its many facets. This repository will serve as a journal of my progress, with regular updates and code commits.

## Future Plans

* **Continue learning** and implementing recursion-based solutions
* **Explore advanced DSA topics**, such as dynamic programming and graph algorithms
* **Refine my problem-solving skills** and coding efficiency
* **Share my knowledge** and insights with the community

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to:

* **Browse through my code implementations** and learn from them
* **Provide feedback, suggestions, or corrections** to my code
* **Use this repository as a reference** for your own DSA learning journey
* **Reach out to me** if you have any questions or need help with a specific problem

## Stay Tuned!

I'll be updating this repository regularly, so be sure to check back often for new code, insights, and progress updates. Let's learn and grow together!
